        <h3>About</h3>
        <span class="singletab">
            This was a shorter month long group project developed for a gamification course.  This project was designed using C# in Unity while using Unity Teams as version control and email for communication.  This project acted as a game/simulation of a time management for a typical student that had to balance funds, hunger, health, work, and studies with the goal of showing why many students struggle with this.  The project was developed in iterations with two prototypes being demoed in class before a final public demostration.  There was an accompaning research paper involving the ideas we were teaching through the project and accessibility features that could be implemented.

        <h3>My Role</h3>
        <span class="singletab">
            My role in this project was handle the front-end user interface design and the main functionality behind the management of the different stats while the other group member worked on randomizing it with a scheduling system.  We both collaboratively worked on the research paper. 
        </span>
        <h3>Results</h3>
        <span class="singletab">
            We successfully completed several prototypes for this project.  The first was demoed to the class while the second was publically demoed to the general public in the cafeteria.  We took feedback and iterated upon our designs after these events.  The project was completed successfully and received full credit (A).
