            This was a shorter month long group project developed for a gamification course.  This project was designed using C# in Unity while using Unity Teams as version control and email for communication.  This project acted as a game/simulation of a time management for a typical student that had to balance funds, hunger, health, work, and studies with the goal of showing why many students struggle with this.  The project was developed in iterations with two prototypes being demoed in class before a final public demostration.  There was an accompaning research paper involving the ideas we were teaching through the project and accessibility features that could be implemented.
