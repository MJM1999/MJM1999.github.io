        <h2>LinkedIn Learning History</h2>
        This page lists LinkedIn Learning courses that I have completed.  While I have gained skills from the college courses, the LinkedIn Learning courses served more as an exposure to new topics rather than adding new skills.  This makes it so that I am more familar with these specific topics and it will be easier to learn them further if needed for a future career.
