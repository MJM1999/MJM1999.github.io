        <h2>Appendix</h2>
        This page is used to go in detail of where I used the various tools and technologies listed on my resume.
        <h3>Tools</h3>
            <h4>Android Studio</h4>
            <span class="doubletab">
                This was the IDE that I used for developing my Android mobile game and the labs for the mobile development course I took in college.
            </span>
            <h4>Collaboration Tools (Shared File Drives, Slack, Zoom)</h4>
            <span class="doubletab">
                Slack and Zoom were used to coommunicate with my group for my capstone project in college.  I used Shared File Drives for that as well as many other group projects throughout my education.
            </span>
            <h4>Linux Command Line</h4>
            <span class="doubletab">
                I utilized the Linux command line in my Systems Programming course as well as both computer security and advanced computer security courses.  I also use the linux command line on my computer that I use for programming.
            </span>
            <h4>Databases (MondoDB Community Server, MS Access)</h4>
            <span class="doubletab">
                I used MS Access for database designs for several group projects for the course Database Management Systems and Human Computer Interaction.  I used MongoDB in my capstone project to store tweets.
            </span>
            <h4>Unity</h4>
            <span class="doubletab">
                I independently learned the Unity IDE with Udemy courses on game programming and I used it to develop my student life simulation.
            </span>
            <h4>Version Control (Git/Github)</h4>
            <span class="doubletab">
                I used Git/Github to manage version control with my group on my capstone project.  I used Unity Teams to manage version control when developing the student life simulation project.
            </span>
            <h4>Virtual Machine (VirtualBox)</h4>
            <span class="doubletab">
            I used a Ubuntu virtual machine to program for C in Systems Programming and I used a Kali Linux virtual machine for Computer Security and Advanced Computer Security.
