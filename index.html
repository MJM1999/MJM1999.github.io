        <h3>About</h3>
        <span class="singletab">
            I graduated from La Roche University with a bachelorâ€™s degree and GPA of 4.00 in computer science.  I also minored in information technology, and gained a certificate in Game Studies.  I have been interested in software development since programming classes in high school.  Throughout college, I attempted to take a wide variety of courses within computer science to gain experience in many different languages, developing for different platforms, and furthering my knowledge of computer science concepts.  I worked on multiple major projects during my time in college that were both individual and group work.  I am currently seeking a remote role in software development that will allow me to continuously learn and improve my skillset.
