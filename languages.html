        <h2>Skill Appendix</h2>
        This page is dedicated to going in-depth to where I learned and used various coding languages.
        <h3>Languages</h3>
            <h4>C</h4>
            <span class="doubletab">
                    I used C in Systems Programming for a weekly lab assignment in a Ubuntu environment on an Odroid device and on a virtual machine.  The final assignment was to recreate a linux command and I chose the copy(cp) command; the project is viewable on my github.
            </span>
            <h4>C#</h4>
            <span class="doubletab">
                I independently learned C# using Udemy and a course on 2D game programming in Unity.  I created a variety of small game projects in C# and my student life simulation project for a gamification course in college.
            </span>
            <h4>HTML/CSS</h4>
            <span class="doubletab">
                HTML and CSS were used in web design courses that I took both in high school and college.  I also used them on my capstone project in college and this portfolio site.
            </span>
            <h4>Java</h4>
            <span class="doubletab">
                Java is the programming language that I have been using the longest.  I started using it for smaller projects and assignments in early high school with Computer Science 1, 2, and AP then I used it in multiple courses in college(programming 2, algorithm analysis).  The major project I used Java in was a restaurant management system for algorithm analysis.
            </span>
            <h4>Javascript</h4>
            <span class="doubletab">
                I learned Javascript independently for use on my capstone project in college.  I have also expanded my knowledge through a Javascript course on LinkedIn Learning.
            </span>
            <h4>LEGV8 (Architecture Language)</h4>
            <span class="doubletab">
                I used architecture language for the labs of computer organization and design.  While I completed no major projects with it, I was able to complete all labs correctly and have gained experience with the concepts of architecture language.
            </span>
            <h4>Python</h4>
            <span class="doubletab">
                For my capstone project, I independently learned Python and used it during my capstone courses in college. 
            </span>
            <h4>SQL</h4>
            <span class="doubletab">
                I used MySQL in labs for Computer Security and Advanced Computer Security in college.  Since then, I have used SQL on many coding challenges and expanded my knowledge with a LinkedIn Learning Course.
            </span>
            <h4>XML</h4>
            <span class="doubletab">
                XML was used during the Android Mobile Development course I took in college.  I utilized it in the labs for the course as well as my mobile game project.
            </span>

            <br><br>
        <h3>Tools</h3>
            <h4>Android Studio</h4>
            <span class="doubletab">
                This was the IDE that I used for developing my Android mobile game and the labs for the mobile development course I took in college.
            </span>
            <h4>Collaboration Tools (Shared File Drives, Slack, Zoom)</h4>
            <span class="doubletab">
                Slack and Zoom were used to coommunicate with my group for my capstone project in college.  I used Shared File Drives for that as well as many other group projects throughout my education.
            </span>
            <h4>Linux Command Line</h4>
            <span class="doubletab">
                I utilized the Linux command line in my Systems Programming course as well as both computer security and advanced computer security courses.  I also use the linux command line on my computer that I use for programming.
            </span>
            <h4>Databases (MondoDB Community Server, MS Access)</h4>
            <span class="doubletab">
                I used MS Access for database designs for several group projects for the course Database Management Systems and Human Computer Interaction.  I used MongoDB in my capstone project to store tweets.
            </span>
            <h4>Unity</h4>
            <span class="doubletab">
                I independently learned the Unity IDE with Udemy courses on game programming and I used it to develop my student life simulation.
            </span>
            <h4>Version Control (Git/Github)</h4>
            <span class="doubletab">
                I used Git/Github to manage version control with my group on my capstone project.  I used Unity Teams to manage version control when developing the student life simulation project.
            </span>
            <h4>Virtual Machine (VirtualBox)</h4>
            <span class="doubletab">
            I used a Ubuntu virtual machine to program for C in Systems Programming and I used a Kali Linux virtual machine for Computer Security and Advanced Computer Security.
