        <h2>Parking Management System Feb 2018 - May 2018</h2>
        <h3>About</h3>
        <span class="singletab">
            This was another 12 week long group project developed for Database Management System.  I also was leader for this project and managed the schedule, communication, and aiding fellow group members.  This database was designed in Microsoft Access as a mock parking system that would act as a way to know if cars were parked in specific spots and when lots were filled (assuming that sensors were in place since we were given an imaginary budget).

        <h3>My Role</h3>
        <span class="singletab">
            As mentioned above, I was leader for this project.  In addition to those duties, I designed the user interface as well as most of the table and table schema with the queries.
        </span>
        <h3>Results</h3>
        <span class="singletab">
            We showcased our project off to the professor at the end of the semester as well as completing an additional presentation.  The professor was impresssed with my work on the user interfaces and the project received full credit (A).
