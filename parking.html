        <span class="singletab">
            This was another 12 week long group project developed for Database Management System.  I also was leader for this project and managed the schedule, communication, and aiding fellow group members.  This database was designed in Microsoft Access as a mock parking system that would act as a way to know if cars were parked in specific spots and when lots were filled (assuming that sensors were in place since we were given an imaginary budget).  I designed the user interface as well as most of the table and table schema with the queries.
