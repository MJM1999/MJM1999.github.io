        <h2>Mock Library Database Feb 2019 - May 2019</h2>
        <h3>About</h3>
        <span class="singletab">
            This was a 12 week long group project developed for Human Computer Interaction.  I was designated as leader for the group and handled scheduling, communication, and other group management tasks as well as working on development and research.  This project was a database system that we designed in Microsoft Access that focused on designing for the major principles of user experience.  The project's function was to act as a mock library system that could be used both by employees and customers.  The project was accompanied with a research paper that focused on accessibility and what future features could be implemented in our database to make it more accessible if we had more time to work on it beyond the semester.

        <h3>My Role In Detail</h3>
        <span class="singletab">
            As mentioned above, my role was leader where I handled scheduling with the group, meeting with the professor, and taking/giving feedback from the group.  In addition to this, I focused on the design of the user interface.  I designed several of the screens for use of a customer or an employee that would allow them to view, checkout, and manage the books.  In addition to this, we all collaboratively worked on the research paper.

        <h3>Results</h3>
        <span class="singletab">
            We showcased our database with a demo to the class alongside a PowerPoint presentation detailling our research paper.  Both of these went successfully and we received full credit (A) for all the work completed on the project.
