        <h3>About</h3>
        <span class="singletab">
            This was a 12 week long group project developed for Human Computer Interaction.  I was designated as leader for the group and handled scheduling, communication, and other group management tasks as well as working on development and research.  This project was a database system that we designed in Microsoft Access that focused on designing for the major principles of user experience.  The project's function was to act as a mock library system that could be used both by employees and customers.  The project was accompaniede with a research paper that focused on accessibility and what future features could be implemented in our database to make it more accessible if we had more time to work on it beyond the semester.
